    <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>This Privacy Policy describes how your personal information is collected, used, and shared when you use the @Watch App.</p>
    <h3>Personal Information</h3>
    <p>The @Watch App does not collect, request, use, share, or otherwise have access to any personal information. It uses your device's clock and time zone information to display the Internet Time.</p>
    <p>The app does not connect to, or transmit personal information over, the Internet - Internet Time doesn't actually require the Internet!</p>
    <p>If enabled on your phone, App Store Analytics may provide us with error reports in the event of a crash. Error reports may include information about your device model.</p>
    <h3>Changes</h3>
    <p>We may update this privacy policy from time to time in order to reflect, for example, changes to our practices or for other operational, legal or regulatory reasons.</p>
